## Perturbation response scanning

### Revise perturbation\_response\_scanning.Rmd

  - \[ \] Separate prs calculation from making figures
  - \[ \] Write a prs.R file that performs the prs scan and generates
    the important necessary tables
  - \[ \] Generate the data
  - \[ \] Make perturbation\_response\_scanning.Rmd *read* the data, not
    calculate it
  - \[ \] Revise .Rmd file until Iâ€™m happy with the output
