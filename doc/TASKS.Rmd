## Perturbation response scanning

### Revise perturbation_response_scanning.Rmd
- [ ] Separate prs calculation from making figures
- [ ] Write a prs.R file that performs the prs scan and generates the important necessary tables
- [ ] Generate the data
- [ ] Make perturbation_response_scanning.Rmd *read* the data, not calculate it
- [ ] Revise .Rmd file until I'm happy with the output
