# Influence profiles

Let $R_{xj}$ be the response of $x$ averaged over  mutations at $j$, where $x$ is either a site $i$, or a mode $n$. Then if we eliminate $x$ by adding or averaging over it, we obtain the influence profile $R_{.j}$.

## Average over modes

## f(R)

e.g. what if we use $[\sqrt{R_{xj}}]$?
