# Is $de^2 \approx \texttt{constant}$?

From [PRS theory](prs_theory.md) it follows that 
$$
<de_i^2>_j \approx \texttt{constant}
$$
This is: the average over mutations and sites of the response at a site $i$ should, in the limit, be the same as the average response at any other site $i'$. 

* [ ] Demonstrate this

* [ ] What about average influence $de_{.,j}$? Is it constant too? Derive theoretically.
