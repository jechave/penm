### Eliminate need to use  `ideal` in enm and lfenm calculations

`ideal` is the ideal protein structure, needed to calculate `v_stress`, `dv_activation`, and `g_entropy_activation`.
To eliminate it, I can just avoid calling these functions to set up and mutate `wt`

1. Moved  `v_stress`, `dv_activation`, and `g_entropy_activation` to *activation.R*
2. Split old enm_energy into two functions: enm_energy_activation (it calls dv_activation and g_entropy_activation) and enm_energy that calculates just v_min and g_entropy


### Eliminate active-site dependent info from enm and lfenm calculations

pdb_active_site indices are used to calculate cmat_activation, kmat_activation, and activation energies. I do not need this in the prot object. If needed, I can add it later. 

1. I moved everything related to active site into file activation.R (need to test it, current tests don't use it).
2. Everything else is independent of either "pdb_site_active" or "ideal". Therefore, it should run for tasks that do not depend on defining active sites.
3. Modified tests accordingly (eliminating dummy active site and ideal).
4. Commited changes to git and github

### Make a one-buttom setup of prot object and test

right now setting up the protein object is done by first reading a pdb file into a bio3d pdb object, then calling prot_sc or prot_ca to initialize the prot object, then calling init_prot to cmplete it. Join prot_sc/prot_ca with init_prot into a single function `set_prot(pdb)` 
Consider adding the enm parameters to prot to be used when passing to other functions(prot)
