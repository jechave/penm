### Eliminate need to use  `ideal` in enm and lfenm calculations

`ideal` is the ideal protein structure, needed to calculate `v_stress`, `dv_activation`, and `g_entropy_activation`.
To eliminate it, I can just avoid calling these functions to set up and mutate `wt`

1. Moved  `v_stress`, `dv_activation`, and `g_entropy_activation` to *activation.R*
2. Split old enm_energy into two functions: enm_energy_activation (it calls dv_activation and g_entropy_activation) and enm_energy that calculates just v_min and g_entropy


### Eliminate active-site dependent info from enm and lfenm calculations

pdb_active_site indices are used to calculate cmat_activation, kmat_activation, and activation energies. I do not need this in the prot object. If needed, I can add it later.
